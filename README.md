# Javascript Identifiers

JavaScript Identifiers are names given to variables, functions, etc. It is the same as identifiers in other programming languages like C, C++, Java, etc. Letâ€™s see identifiers for variable names.

The following are legal variable names:

```javascript
val
val1
result
5demo // Invalid
_5demo // Valid
```

While naming your variables in JavaScript, keep the following rules in mind.

- You should not use any of the JavaScript reserved keywords as a variable name. These keywords are mentioned in the next section. For example, break or boolean variable names are not valid.
- JavaScript variable names should not start with a numeral (0-9). They must begin with a letter or an underscore character. For example, 5demo is an invalid variable name but _5demo is a valid one.
- JavaScript variable names are case-sensitive. For example, Name and name are two different variables.
